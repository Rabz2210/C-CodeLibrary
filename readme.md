# Welcome to C++ Code Library!

Hi! This is my attempt to create a code libarary of famous implementations in terms of data sturcture or classical algorithemic problems to be used for inteview preparation purpose or for the use of competitive coding.I will keep updating the files here as and when new implementations are added. 

***Motive***

> The taks at hand is to accomplish at-least onedatastructure/algorithm/Classic problem on a daily basis to build a habit along with the accompanying knowledge. This library can also be used to solve or to reffernce implementations duing a competitve coding contest.
